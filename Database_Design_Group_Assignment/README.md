# Water Quality Database and Prediction System

This project implements a database system for water quality data, along with API endpoints for CRUD operations and a prediction script using machine learning.

## Project Components

1. Database Design
2. API Development
3. Data Fetching and Prediction Script

## 1. Database Design

### SQL Database

- RDBMS: [MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite]
- Schema: At least two tables based on water quality dataset
- Structure:
  - [Table 1 Name]
  - [Table 2 Name]
  - [Additional tables if applicable]
- Primary and foreign keys defined

### NoSQL Database

- MongoDB implementation

## 2. API Development

### Technology Stack

- Framework: [Chosen Framework]

### Endpoints

- Create (POST): `/api/[resource]`
- Read (GET): `/api/[resource]` and `/api/[resource]/:id`
- Update (PUT): `/api/[resource]/:id`
- Delete (DELETE): `/api/[resource]/:id`

## 3. Data Fetching and Prediction Script

### Fetch Data

- Script to fetch the latest entry from the API

### Prediction

- Loads the machine learning model created in "Intro to Machine Learning"
- Prepares input data
- Uses the model to make predictions
