# Data Augmentation

## Project Description
This project focuses on implementing various data augmentation techniques using TensorFlow. Data augmentation is a powerful method used to increase the diversity of training data without actually collecting new data. This is particularly useful in deep learning where large amounts of data are needed to achieve good performance.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Explain what data augmentation is and its benefits.
- Understand when to use data augmentation.
- Implement various data augmentation techniques.
- Use machine learning to automate data augmentation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6.12
- numpy 1.16
- tensorflow 1.15
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files should be executable and end with a new line.
- Code should follow the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.4).
- Each module, class, and function should have documentation.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install tensorflow==1.15 numpy==1.16 tensorflow-datasets matplotlib
```
