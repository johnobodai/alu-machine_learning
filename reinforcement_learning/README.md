# Deep Q-Learning with Keras-RL

This project demonstrates the implementation of Deep Q-Learning using the Keras-RL library and the OpenAI Gym environment. The goal is to train an agent to play Atari's Breakout.

---

## Project Structure

The project contains two main scripts:

1. **train.py**: 
   - Trains a DQN agent on the Breakout environment using Keras-RL.
   - Saves the trained policy network to a file named `policy.h5`.

2. **play.py**: 
   - Loads the trained policy network from `policy.h5`.
   - Allows the trained agent to play a game of Breakout.

## Requirements

This project is designed to run on **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS** with the following dependencies:

- **Python**: 3.5
- **Numpy**: 1.15
- **Keras**: 2.2.4
- **Keras-RL**: 0.4.2
- **TensorFlow**: 1.12
- **Gym**: 0.17.2
- **Pillow**
- **H5py**

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/alu-machine_learning.git
   cd alu-machine_learning/reinforcement_learning/deep_q_learning
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Install dependencies using `conda` or `pip`:
   ```bash
   conda create -n dqn_env python=3.5
   conda activate dqn_env
   pip install numpy==1.15 keras==2.2.4 keras-rl gym==0.17.2 tensorflow==1.12 Pillow h5py
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import keras; import gym; print('Environment ready!')"
   ```

---

## Usage

### Training the Agent

Run `train.py` to train the DQN agent:
```bash
python3 train.py
```
The trained model will be saved to `policy.h5`.

### Testing the Agent

Run `play.py` to let the trained agent play a game of Breakout:
```bash
python3 play.py
```

---

## Files

- **train.py**: Trains the DQN agent using Keras-RL.
- **play.py**: Runs the trained agent to play Breakout.
- **policy.h5**: The trained policy network (generated after running `train.py`).

---

## Notes

- Ensure you have the correct Python version (3.5) as specified in the requirements.
- Training an agent can be computationally expensive. Consider using a GPU if available.
- For compatibility, avoid using Python versions above 3.8, as Keras-RL and some dependencies might not work.
