Convolutional Neural Networks - Convolution and Pooling
Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for implementing convolution and pooling operations in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Description

The project consists of Python scripts that perform various operations related to CNNs, focusing specifically on convolution and pooling. Each script corresponds to a specific task, such as valid convolution, same convolution, convolution with padding, strided convolution, convolution with channels, multiple kernels, and pooling.
Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    NumPy
    Matplotlib

Usage

To use the scripts, run the corresponding main.py file for each task. For example:

bash

./0-main.py
