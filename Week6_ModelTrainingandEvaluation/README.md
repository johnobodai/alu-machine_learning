Machine Learning Project README
Overview

This project aims to predict [explain your prediction task briefly]. It utilizes various machine learning models and incorporates optimization techniques to improve model performance and generalization.
Optimization Techniques Used
Logistic Regression

python

# Train Logistic Regression model with regularization (L2 by default)
print("Training Logistic Regression model...")
lr = LogisticRegression(C=1.0)  # Set C parameter for regularization strength (adjust as needed)
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

    Explanation:
        Adjust C parameter to control the strength of regularization (default is 1.0). Increase C for weaker regularization or decrease for stronger regularization.

Decision Tree Classifier

python

# Train Decision Tree model
print("Training Decision Tree model...")
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=None, min_samples_split=2)  # Set max_depth and min_samples_split (adjust as needed)
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

    Explanation:
        Tune max_depth and min_samples_split to control tree depth and node splitting threshold. max_depth=None allows the tree to grow until all leaves are pure or contain less than min_samples_split samples.

Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

python

# Train Neural Network model with optimizations
print("Training Neural Network model...")
nn = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100,), max_iter=1000, alpha=0.0001, learning_rate_init=0.001,
                  early_stopping=True, validation_fraction=0.1)
nn.fit(X_train, y_train)

    Explanation:
        max_iter: Set to 1000 to ensure sufficient iterations for convergence.
        alpha: Regularization parameter (0.0001 by default) controls L2 penalty.
        learning_rate_init: Initial learning rate (0.001 by default) for optimization.
        early_stopping: Stops training when validation score doesn't improve (True to enable).
        validation_fraction: Fraction of training data used for validation during training (0.1 by default).
